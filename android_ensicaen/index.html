				<h3>Innovation</h3>
				<p>When you are working on math starting from 10<sup>th</sup> grade, you usually need a calculator. Sometimes in background, people like me used to listen musics on YouTube. The problem to listen songs is that you need a physical calculator with the smartphone open. However, physical calculators are expensive, so you are tended to pick a free calculator application like <a href="https://www.numworks.com/fr/simulateur/" target="_blank">NumWorks</a>. This raises a new problem, work as you are listening to youtube need to have the youtube prenium account. Otherwise you cannot quit the application without stopping the sound. That's why I developed a calculator with youtube integrated ! </p>

				<h3>Principles UX - Joel Marsh</h3>
				<p>For the choice of my elements and color, I followed the courses of Joel Marsh, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/visual-design-principles/" target="_blank"> Chapter 8, Lesson 51, 52, 53.</a></p>

				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>Lesson 51 : </strong>The goal here is to make something look "heavier" than others with contrast. It draws attention more easily to help users notice the things that matter. Important buttons are those with operators and operands. So they have a "lighter" color than other functionnal buttons, in grey.</li>
					<li><strong>Lesson 52 : </strong>In this lesson, we understand that colors have interpretation. They split the meaning of same things. While operands and operators have the same importance (they are in contrast) and they are both buttons, their roles are separated. Consequently, they have two different colors, white for numbers and orange for operands.</li>
					<li><strong>Lesson 53 : </strong>The creation of patterns moves the user's eye to important things. <i>"Human brains have a particular talent for patterns and sequences. Whenever something in nature happens over and over, we will quickly notice. In fact, we donâ€™t just notice, we think about those things differently"</i>. Every buttons with the same main functions are therefore concentrated in blocks.</li>
				</ul>	
				<p>In addition, something we can understand natively and was mentionned in UX for beginners, we want users to not be able to make errors. In our application, we locked the possibility to press two binary operators. When we pressed a binary operator without first operand, we automatically complete with the last anwser.</p>			
			</section>
			<section id="tests">
				<h3>Unit tests</h3>
				<p>For the test part, I used the following strategy :</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Firstly</strong> : I developed in TDD Test-Driven-Development for the calculator.</li>
					<li><strong>Secondly : </strong> I writed tests in this order : Nominal tests, Limit tests and critical tests.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are unit tests, but also integration tests when it was possible. You will also find mocks and especially instrumentation tests because both applications require to interact with the environment (the context) and you cannot test it on simple unit tests.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="application">
				<h3>Application</h3>
				<p>The applications were design to fit perfectly in their environment. They are both responsive and can go either vertical or horizontal. It was possible thanks to constraint layout, which is more adapted for complex applications (otherwise you should prefer something more basic as LinearLayout), and largely because components in this layout can be and must be declared as dynamical (they are constraint), which means their size relies on the environment (you can make components dynamic in linear too, but it is not its primarly goal). For the calculator, I used a combination of different layouts. Indeed the application itself is constraint, but the historic view (the scroll view) is way more adapted in a linear format.</p>
				<p>Something hard to see in the Calculator but easier in the game is the resource manager. Every resources such as images, sound, strings of different languages, animations etc... were stocked either in their original format or in XML in the 'res' folder, and were treated as the android way (R.drawable.X, R.raw.X) instead of the basic way we learnt (assets/img/etc...). We can see that when we are making android applications, R.drawable.fox for example is kinda logical and simplier than getClass().getResource(path).toExternalStream().</p>
				<p>Finally, a lot of services run in background such as Youtube parser or animations. To do so I used Thread implementation, but not the actual one, the android one. It means by having a handler, and get the main looper (principal Thread) to post all services needed (can be posted delayed without any other implementations). Even if applications are rotated, the context is saved and the services won't be destroyed.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="calculator">
				<h3>Calculator</h3>
				<p>The calculator is using a WebView to display youtube contents. This is a JavaScript Engine integrated in android to make research efficiency. It has a proper blinking effect (now patched), and stocked every user's inputs in a local database. It means that when the user launches his calculator, it will keep all his calculus and he can clicked on one input to automatically copy it.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="rss">
				<h3>RSS</h3>
				<p>The RSS included in the calculator is a youtube parser. I have a youtube playlist saved in a static config file, and when I first double tap the logo, the calculator will recuperate every videos on it with the SAX API and starts one randomly. The other double taps are for the foreground or background music.</p>

			<section id="bonus">
				<h3>Bonus</h3>
				<p>For a bonus, I made a puzzle game which will be soon deployed on google Play store (at the moment I am writing this report). For more details, you can see the README File of Eyefox Puzzle folder. The goal here was to understand the process of android application deployment, a first approach of the ECS architecture (approach is the word) and to write <u>reusable code</u> (package westerlib).</p>

				</figure>
				
				<p>Both applications try to follow the MVVM design pattern. My views are listeners of ViewModel changes and they deleague every inputs to ViewModel. ViewModel is the only one who knows the model and it can interact with. Model does not import ViewModel or View and ViewModel does not import View.</p>
				<p>Both applications are available in many languages. The calculator can translate english to japanese and vice versa. The game cannot translate, but it applies the default language of the phone (local) during the launch. The game is available in french, english, portuguese, spanish, german and italian.</p>
				<p>In my side, I made a lot of researches about android components, layout and UX with Joel Marsh. Some interesting things that I had noticed but not the occasion to write it was for example the privacy. If you collect data of a user, you have to write it. It is illegal whenever the user cannot see the privacy. Collect data is real term designed of the collection or the sharing of user informations outside. It includes the storing of data in your server, it does not include the storing of data in the user's phone. An other good thing of Google is that they really care about the education of children. If you want to deploy your product, it is easier than to certify it as 'playable for children' towards Google. To guarantee the integrity, you have tools offered by Google that you can implement with gradle, at some code parts to check if the binary code is exactly the original one (to exclude cheaters of multiplayer games for example). I also learned about signed products and had to create my own private key. They are a lot of things I could talk about from my researches, but it would take too long time and it is not the case, I only write informations you may not find in other reports.</p>
				<p>During the development sessions, I had the occasion to help my colleagues such as <strong>Lucie Chauvet</strong> or <strong>Valentin Salic</strong>. It was especially in the understanding of Java and android technologies, and an other part was for the understanding of how API works.</p>

				<h3>Review</h3>
				<p>First of all I was sceptic about doing android projects since we sold me this as a drag and drop components in XML files. But it was only after 'forced' researches I should say that I finally began to understand it well and realize that it was someting interesting. Google designed it so well and I think we should sometimes take lessons from them (I was not paid to say this I swear). With every things I have done, I'll try to dress the pros and cons.</p>
				<h3>Pros : </h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>The game : </strong> I think the initiative to start a project from scratch by using knowledge we just acquired is a good point. Especially that I just started to build my own library (my reusable code).</li>
					<li><strong>User experience : </strong> All applications were tested either by friends or family. I listened to their feedbacks about button placements and colors in order to make a better version of applications.</li>
					<li><strong>Privacy : </strong> I write my privacy for the game.</li>
					<li><strong>Clean code : </strong> I try my best to make the code autodocumented and make proper packages.</li>
					<li><strong>Critics : </strong> I was open to critics, and tried to fix every single things we could have reproached me.</li>
					<li><strong>Subject : </strong>Every instructions were followed.</li>
					<li><strong>Standard : </strong> This page was validated by W3C Validator.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Cons : </h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>Vocabulary : </strong> I decided to write this report in english because I am pretty sure I'll have to write a lot in english in the future, but for now my vocabulary is limited.</li>
					<li><strong>Time : </strong> because I wanted to develop something ambitious without being told to, I could not implement MVVM of android. It has a special class ViewModel which also save context with LiveData. I now have the time, but after two weeks of coding only android, I give me rest.</li>
					<li><strong>Anti-pattern : </strong>For the saving context, I used the Singleton design pattern which is an anti-pattern. However, I saw that many class methods in android SDK were static, so I still don't know if I had to use it instead of my own anti-pattern.</li>
					<li><strong>Auto-critic : </strong>It is super hard to make an auto-critic, maybe visible in the lack of sections for pros and cons.</li>
